## Project Goals: 
Using our dataset containing information on 4410 employees with over 20 features to analyze, we plan to identify the factors that contribute most to attrition, predict the likelihood of current employees leaving their positions within the company, and determine what steps could be taken to reduce attrition levels in the future.

## Dataset: 
https://github.com/rukky022/AI_HR_Attrition/tree/main/original_data
* The data_dictionary.xlsx file contains information describing the meaning and domain of the features used in the rest of the files. 
* The employee_survey_data.csv contains employees’ responses to a survey on their satisfaction with their job, work environment, and the work-life balance at the company. 
* The general_data.csv file contains basic information about each employee including their age, gender, job level, education, and many other features. 
* The manager_survey_data.csv contains employees’ responses to a survey on their managers.

## Processing the Data:

- What was the data like
- Did we have to process outliers/normalize the data
- Did we have to encode categorical features

---

## Implementing the Models:

- Why did we choose the models we did
- How did we choose evaluation metrics
- What did hyper-parameter optimization do

---

## Conclusion:

- What factors contribute to attrition
- Which model would be recommended to predict attrition in the future
